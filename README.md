### Abstract
This project uses several A.I. sound tools (SampleRNN, Jukebox, AIVA, Spleeter, WaveNet) and text tools (GPT-2, GPT-J-6B) to create a fake artist: Sravillit Tcoss that DOES NOT work as smoothly as one would have expected. Intentional glitches in audio, visual and textual elements are added to emphasis such A.I. failure. Through this project, I hope to experiment with various tools and more importantly, address on the limitation of A.I., and warn towards a blind trust and usage of A.I..

### 1. Inspiration
The inspiration of creating a fake artist is from my initial idea of utilizing both text and sound tools to create a project. The best medium for text & sound is songs, which includes lyrics and music. Therefore, at very early stage I've set the goal to be creating a song and an artist page. However, after some experiment with the sound tools, especially SampleRNN, I found that the quality of the audio generated from my own training was not ideal at all. And that's when I made the decision to stop further training and concluded that the sound tools are not capable of generating good audios. So, I shifted my project idea from creating a "good" fake artiist to a

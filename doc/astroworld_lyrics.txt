Bad-bad news, I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news, bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is all)

How would you feel if I had you?
Trust me, you'd be mad too
But shawty, we can be mad cool
Just hit me if anything past due
Your family told you I'm a bad move
Plus I'm already a black dude
Leavin' the bathroom, my hands is half-rinsed
If only a nigga just had sense
Speaking in past tense
It's been a week and a half since
We ain't been speaking and that meant
You feeling free in my absence
I've been going through a lot behind this glass tint, yeah
(This is all, this is all)

Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is-)
I know they told you I'd be bad for you
Don't worry I'll be back for you
All the money and cars
Stripper hoes and the tattoos, bad news
Back off a coffee bean
Reflecting on all you see (this is all, this is all)

Stressing over award shows
She's stressin' over her wardrobe
Bought the mansion on foreclose
No matter how many tickets your tour sold
You feel this deep in your torso
Feel like someone's readin' your horoscope
Some shit only me and the Lord knows
SOS, that's for those who hear this in morse code
Too many doors closed Cul-de-sacs and foor doors
Still ended up at the North Pole
This is where remorse goes
This shit'll have you in divorce court
Fighting over your seeds, writing over your deeds, sliding over your keys
Alimony and fees, as your lawyer proceeds
To give out bad news

I'm just bad-bad news
Good thing, the two, Bonnie and Clyde
The money and who?
It's bad news, bad-bad for you
But I'm back on the coffee bean
Anything in between (this is all, this is all)
Back of the coffee line
Back-back-back in the bathroom line (this is all)

Nine light years away, just outside of the Kepler solar system
We find ourself consumed and utterly mesmerized
With a story of a young rebel against the system
Refusing to conform or comply to the ways of authority
He chose the mood of "f*ck this shit"

At that moment, the one known as Jacq turned to Scott
Chose to jump off his mama porch and lead the stampede of lost souls
In the middle of their metamorphosis, not quite through with their journey
Ain't made it through whatever the f*ck they gon' be in life
But whatever it is, it's better than here
So f*ck you and f*ck this

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
Yeah that's all I need in my fantasy

You remind me of my ex, crazy love
We designed our love around the drugs
We both feelin' this cup, we both tryna f*ck
I'mma rub a dub, tryna get a nut

No monogamy, ménage with me
Pornography surrounding me
You get high with me, you come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy
All these flashing lights blinding me
Give you some of me, you want all of me
And get high with me, and come down with me
That's all I need in my fantasy

The story of the bastard was never told
The soul of a bastard was never sold
Can he survive? Or could he fall in love?
Living like a bronco, lifestyle wild and untamed
Sit sip at the top, a long list of no named
Misfits can't wait to get a chance to say f*ck you to the ones that say f*ck you
Tell 'em do ya thing, Codeine and cocaine cartels
Who leads the charge of this young mob?
La flame he is in his head, the world is yours

Wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes in the farms
Might gotta got to rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy, cause my ambition's too frantic
I might need to move to Atlantis, cause my mind's too outlandish

It's the rodeo, time to get started
Houston nigga, goin' James Harden
They would swallow all the niggas in the projects
Wonder why a nigga went cold hearted
They wanna put my soul up on an auction
But I'mma make 'em take the fall like August
And they gon' vote me right in on my caucus
And I'mma show these niggas how to get lawless
Why your hands out, asking "could you hold one?"
Who do I owe, nigga, no one
They bigging you up but you low down
Animated acting frozen
I got porno pics, wish I can post them
Stackin' Franklins, I can't fold 'em
Niggas askin' for the old him
But I'm way too young to be the old him
I'mma make this chick crack Lamar Odom
Till I climb to the top of the podium

So wake up nigga, gotta get the cake up, nigga
Niggas in the bushes, niggas on the farm
Might gotta rake up a nigga
I'm way too antsy, cause my ambition's too frantic
I might move out to Atlantis, cause my mind's too outlandish
We gon' rule the world, we gon' rule the world
We gon' rule the world

La Flame says "let your ambition carry you

You really can't make it on this side
Lot of lone stars on this side

Ball until we fall on this side
Lit late night on this side
You never come around past midnight
You miss everything on this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side
I made a lot of money on this side
Lost a lot of money on this side
Had my first kiss on this side
Learned a lot of shit about this side
Clearly I've been thinking about this side
Tryna get back on this side
Tryna get back whats been mine
I gotta get back on this side
Really miss the feeling of the late nights
Shit we used to do around midnight
Hangin' on the corner had shit tight
Doin' all the drugs had to get right
If I could get my partner back it would be nice
He would shoot the one, wouldn't think twice
He was too involved with the street life
Only way to live on this side
This side, this side, this side
This side, this side, this side, this side
This side, this side
This side, this side, this side

Young rich nigga from the north side
Paid my dues on this side
Flipping up bricks on this side
I made it out the hood I'm on the other side
All my niggas on this side
Keep it one hundred on this side
Love to get money on this side
No new niggas on this side
Look at my diamonds don't get blind
You better handcuff you ho with a zip tie (cuff!)
I will take a busta down on this side
Broke niggas stand to the left side
Handsome and Wealthy on this side
I came from the bottom and now I'm on top thats phenomenal
This side, this side, this side, this side
If I do not make it I wonder where I will go
This side, this side, this side
Graduated from the midget
This the life I was living
Graduated to a million
It's the money that I'm getting
Graduated from a hotbox now I ride around in a Bentley
How we do it on

This side, this side, this side
Always, always this side
This side, this side, this side
Thats right, thats right
You ever come around thats midnight
Midnight, midnight
You know how I like my lean, po' up
Just right
On this side
Find everything you need, everything you need on this side
This side, this side, this side
Is right

Hung up phone, break up
If he fall will he fly? Sure wouldn't take much
For you to find out, jump
How you took that plunge
If not, we're in the same spot
How could you judge?
How could you judge?

Cuzzo said we in the store, yeah, we 'bout to drop a 4
He pass the cigarette, I choke

Now you know you love your own now
Hit the stage, they got their hands up, don't put your nose down
I ain't knockin' nigga, I knocked the door down, for sure now
Whole crew, I swear they counting on me
Gold chains, gold rings, I got an island on me
Houses on me, he got them ounces on him
Holy father, come save these niggas, I'm styling on 'em
Good lord, I see my good fortune in all these horses
I'm driving too fast to stop, so all these signs, I ignore them
Distant sky from north of the border, my chips is in order
My mind's big as a porter so now niggas support a nigga

Oh, don't pray for love
Oh, say love
Just ask the lonely, oh
Just ask the lonely, oh

Pray for who lost they fate, and died too young
Pray for the ones I hate, the ones I love
Pray for my liver when I'm off, in this club
I pray that the, demons go away, they hauntin' us
Man I can't take no more of this lifestyle we been livin'
Man I can't take no more of the white powers in position
Gotta grab OJ wheel, gotta scoop up J Rich
Told Chase we ain't goin' back, you know, we gotta hitch
I mean I'm, aggravated, agitated, I admit
Intoxicated, animated, got me feelin' kinda lit
Contemplatin' fornicatin', might as well f*ck up some shit
They lookin' at me way too crazy, got me feelin' communist
But I'm just tryin' to save the throne, pray for Bones, pray for Stix
If my album never sell, then we gon' hit that lick
Tell Lamar, call up Cash, tell him buzz me at the Ritz
It's the weekend, we off the deep end, you need to pray for us

Oh, don't pray for love
Oh, say love
Just ask the lonely, oh
Just ask the lonely, oh

Pills
Have you ever been through life's
Challenges? Promises?
Get down here, I'm prayin'

Let me tell the lost tale about Jacques
Let me tell you how I turned Scott
How I went down on the block
Waterfall around ten o'clock
And how we came up gettin' all the knots, dodgin' cops, yeah
'Fore a nigga had the locks
'Fore a nigga had the chain, 'fore I had the bops
Always kept my city on me like it was a swatch
Every time we in the party, took it up a notch
Now I'm thinkin' 'bout this new girl, and she doin' pop (Ohhh)
Wanna know my dick longer than a Pringle box
(Don't pray for love)
Tired of seein' these black kids on the face of FOX (Ohhh)
And f*ck CNN, they don't wanna see us win (Said I-)
Mama don't you worry no, no more, worry no, no more
I'ma take you from the first to the ninetieth floor
You always told me what I plant, that shit gotta grow
And anything I detonate, that shit gotta blow
Pray for love

No, oh
We don't pray for love, no more
We don't wanna see you on the cover of a carton, no more
We don't wanna see you on the news, no more
All alone

Underrated is an understatement
They tryin' to test greatness, a nigga tryna get paid
These niggas fiends watchin' all of my moves
Cause the music like crack, got me cookin' all day
I'm right here, you know where I stay
And if you don't, then ask your girl, she probably know the way
She like my show lights, she want to be wife
She know that if she got me that she gon' be good for life
So I pull out 'fore the climax
Faster than a hi-hat, sorry baby, I don't play
And if I did, you know my kids would be ballin'
And my daughter gon' never meet a nigga like me
My niggas pull up in that Rolls-Royce
Like they sell that coke boy, shout out to the Coke Boys
They never pray for us, nobody pray for us
Nobody pray, no, no, no, no, no

Oh, don't pray for love
Oh, say love (just ask the lonely)
Just ask the lonely, oh (just ask the lonely)

You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell

I can tell 'bout the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong one and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won't fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Basis to break all my momma's vases
I shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn't eight then
Always hit the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you 'bout the nights out in Fort Bend

I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell

I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
No you don't tell

Yeah, I can tell 'bout the night tales
And all the dry wells and the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows
How we came up and how we came down
Going donuts, coffee couldn't help now
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to great for straight profits making his demands now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble 'bout it
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle
Five-o-four hot boys, might have to bad rap like Silkk the Shocker
But I'mma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher
I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about you
I'll bombaclot you, bomba bomba blocka shot you
Bling and bang, a bang a rapper
Bangarang, I brought my money back
Orangutan dollars, ring-a-ling
Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang

I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell

No you don't tell

Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
Won't you and your friends come eat with me
And let me show you how to whip that recipe
She say your bad ass always had a thing for sweets
Guess that's why I'm so hot on the street
Won't you come over and eat with me
And let me show you how to whip-whip-whip that recipe

I don't want your apple pie, mama
I ain't tryna dap up niggas blockin' me
Made it out the spot, straight to quintana
And I'm still that nigga with diamonds on my blocka
I say when they come at me I bet they have some backup
I bet I take your bitch, she take that dick straight up the stasher
Keep an ounce of garlic just to keep away the Draculas
I just seek out to find my home, why can't they just leave me 'lone

Cause I don't want your apple pie, no no mama
I don't want your apple pie, no
I don't want your apple pie, mami
I don't want your apple pie no more
I need my own pepper pepper, please, pepper, pepper seeds
I need my own reme-remedy, my own legacy
Yeah I don't want your apple pie, mama
I need my own pepper please
I need my own legacy, my own recipe

I came to get it nominated
From a spot that y'all seen Bun B blow up
I hate to break your heart, I bet I'll make the mark
That y'all see a legacy go up
Goyard done break your pockets
Boy I'm out in Paris lettin' all these beats go up
I make in one appearance what these niggas hatin' makin' in four seasons
H-Town, know we gon' stunt
I'm for real and your Rollie tick
Look bitch, this the Rodeo
But I ain't goin' out for your bullshit
I don't want your apple pie, mama
I don't wanna dap up niggas blockin' me
I am everything except a rapper
Shit I got at least 25 lighters on my dresser

Rocks in the night
Rocks in the night
Rocks in the night
Rocks in the night
Rocks in the night
Rocks in the night

Que sera sera, so the story goes
On and on and back and forth, the evolution's absolute
Tours and shows and groupie whores
Wouldn't hesitate if he had to shoot
Though he'd rather not
Forever been the elephant in the room
That everyone can't wait to run and tell about
The head to the body of the belligerent militant group
That sponsors the revolution that will not be televised
Decide to cross those lil' guys, you've obviously been ill-advised
Yet and still, the question that arises to the mind
Will he make it? Was it worth it?
Did he win? Will he survive the Rodeo?

Ya you know we gon' be aight

Til' it took flight and ended up on the shoulder

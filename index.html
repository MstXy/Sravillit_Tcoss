      <p>
        I am Sravillit Tcoss, a rising rapper and producer. I am from the South Bay and I've been writing rhymes since I was 13. I'm currently pursuing my music career as a solo artist, and I write and produce my own music. I am also a member of the 7th & Ithaca group. We've released our debut album <i>'Pay Day'</i> on September 24th, 2018. I'm originally from Compton, CA. I was born in 1983. I've been a part of a lot of groups and I've done a lot of different things, but my main focus is rap, write lyrics and produce beats. <span id="error_intro">A young, black, <span class="glitch">queer</span>, feminist, and trans woman, also the first rapper to have an album called <i>'Savage Love'</i> that was all about <span class="glitch">sex</span>.
